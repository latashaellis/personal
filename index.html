    <p>Hello, my name is Latasha Ellis and I currently attend Jones College Prep. While maintaining an athletic career as a varsity track sprinter, I have continued to strive for excellence in both my academics and extracurriculars. Recently, I have been selected to attend the 2017 Presidential Inauguration as a result of my outstanding grades and dedication to the field of science and technology. Also, I am a founder of a creative club at my school called The Positivity Club that embodies community service. Coming from a lower class family with little college experience, I hope to get the opportunity to run collegiate track to honor all of the sacrifices my family has made for me. My hard work ethic will bring leadership, teamwork, and motivation to everything I try to accomplish. Sprinting is my passion and I dream of running at a college level.</p>
